# Nova Raids Beta v0.3.1 Hotfix
- Teleporting away from raids via /home, /spawn, etc. will no longer deal damage to the boss from the battle ending
- Added experience gain toggle to config.json, with this enabled experience will still not be gained if players manage to flee from the encounter
- Boss clone battles are properly stopped when needed

# Nova Raids Beta v0.3.1 *(Patch Update)*

## Additions
- Added `/raid schedule` command with the permission node `novaraids.schedule`. This allows the user to view the upcoming raid schedules.

## Config Changes
- Most config properties will now automatically generate and fill the file with default values if they've been left out.
- Added `friendship` to boss.json/pokemon_details. (default: 50)
- Added `friendship_override` to boss.json/catch_settings. (default: 50)
- Removed `form` from boss.json/pokemon_details.
- Changed `features` in boss.json/pokemon_details to a weighted list. Previous features will automatically transfer to this new format.
  - New format:
  ```json
  "features": [
    {
      "feature": "mega_evolution=mega",
      "weight": 5.0
    }
  ]
  ```
- Added `keep_features` to boss.json/catch_settings. (default: false)
- Added `ai_skill_level` to boss.json/boss_details. This is a value from 0 to 5, 0 is random AI, 5 is the best AI. (default: 3)
- Added `blacklisted_categories` to messages.json/discord. These categories will not have webhook messages sent for them.
- Added `blacklisted_bosses` to messages.json/discord. These bosses will not have webhook messages send for them.
- Added `bosses_have_infinite_pp` to config.json/raid_settings. Setting this to true will give all bosses moves 10,000 PP.
- Added `automatic_battles` to config.json/raid_settings. Setting this to true will force players into another boss battle after a set delay.
- Added `automatic_battle_delay_seconds` to config.json/raid_settings. This is the delay before the automatic battle is started, I recommend keeping this above 2 seconds, or it may not work.
- Added `join_raid_after_voucher_use` to config.json/item_settings/voucher_settings. Setting this to true will have players automatically join the raid they start using a voucher.
- Added `player_linked_raid_balls` to config.json/item_settings/raid_ball_settings. Disabling this option will allow players to use other player's raid balls.
- Added `override_category_distribution` to boss.json/raid_details. Enabling this setting will override the full category distribution section, instead of just an individual placement.
- Renamed `override_category_rewards` in boss.json/raid_details/reward_distribution/places to `override_category_placement` to better fit its functionality.

## Bug Fixes
- Locations in other worlds will no longer make the timer count down past 0.
- Multiverse worlds now work with locations (probably?).
- NovaRaids will now load in singleplayer.
- Battles now stop properly to avoid issues such as trick item stealing, and mega evolution not reverting.
- Boss clones will now (properly) disappear when debug is false.
- Webhooks follow the config now for automatically deleting.
- If a border radius is less than 30, and Pokémon are set to be visible in config.json, they will get teleported to the border radius instead of being locked at 30.
- If a player deals damage to the boss, but loses the battle, the damage they dealt will be registered rather than it being 0.
- The `species_override` catch setting is now functional
- Players will no longer receive a catch encounter if they leave the raid
- Pokemon will no longer receive EXP from raid bosses.
- Boss battle's flee-distance is now set to the arena's border radius x 2, effectively preventing fleeing from boss battles.
- Catch encounters and rewards with the "participating" placement will now include.. participating players :)
- Certain timezones will now properly parse for schedules

Use this website to generate cron expressions: https://freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html. Please remove the "year" section of the expression (the last one), it will crash your server. It should total six sections in total!
- These cron expressions allow for the use of #, L, W, LW, and ? modifiers as well.
- The Cron API used in Nova Raids is the following: https://github.com/jmrozanec/cron-utils
